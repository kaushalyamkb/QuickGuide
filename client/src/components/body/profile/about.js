                    The main problem that we have focused is, how to manage a supermarket easily 
                    during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    Because of the COVID-19 pandemic we need to follow the health guidelines. So 
                    managing supermarket cannot be done as in the past. To manage this situation, we can 
                    use a web application system.

                    It reduces the time and manpower required for management and maintenance of 
                    different tasks. It reduces the paper work in existing system, hence it is economical and 
                    efficient. Also it will help to keep health guidelines as far as possible. Using this system 
                    customer can manage their day today works done with supermarket easily and without a 
                    risk. Not only customers but also managers can maintain the supermarket easily and also
